# Progress bar component in Angular/Ionic
This is a demo of a very simple progress-bar component done using Ionic 3.

![Dependencies status](https://david-dm.org/dnchia/ProgressBar-Component.svg)

## How to use it
The demo can be executed like any other Ionic application, using the Ionic CLI command: `ionic serve` to execute it in development mode.
The demo is optimized to work in device-like views, but it will work without any problem in web views.

## References
This demo example was done following the tutorial made by Joshua Morony ([@joshuamorony](https://github.com/joshuamorony)) in 
[Build a Simple Progress Bar Component in Ionic 2 & 3](https://www.joshmorony.com/build-a-simple-progress-bar-component-in-ionic-2/), all credits to him.

## In the future
This is a very simple progress bar component, I pretend to improve it including more variables in order to
customize it, for example, to specify the maximum, the color or a loading pattern.
